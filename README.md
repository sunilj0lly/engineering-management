# Awesome leadership
This is a collection of articles mostly related to leadership and learning.

A lot of these links were discovered via the excellent [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) weekly email, which I highly recommend signing up to.

It was also inspired by [Peter Cook's vast library of tech leading articles](https://github.com/PeterCookDev/TechLeading).


### Basecamp Employee Handbook
https://github.com/basecamp/handbook
> For over 10 years, we didn’t have a handbook. In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to a company of over 50, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it... This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated.

This is probably the cleanest and most concise handbook I've seen. Making it public like this is a bold move too and I imagine only increases the transparency in the company about how it operates.

### Head to Lead People and Be a Manager

>Since 2013-ish, I’ve been keeping a collection of links and notes on the broad topics of “leadership” and “management” on this very Google doc. I shared it with friends who are transitioning to management roles but kept it private to the world at large. Then I figured I should “open source” it. 

This rough and ready Google Doc looks terrible but contains excellent summaries of articles related to leadership and management. I often read the notes on 1:1s each week to remind me how to run mine more effectively.
