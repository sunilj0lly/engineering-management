# Awesome engineering management
This is a collection of articles and posts related to management in software development.

A lot of these links were discovered via the excellent [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) weekly email, which I highly recommend signing up to.

It was also inspired by [Peter Cook's vast library of tech leading articles](https://github.com/PeterCookDev/TechLeading).

### “Writing is Thinking”—an annotated twitter thread
https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/writing-is-thinking-an-annotated-twitter-thread-2a75fe07fade?gi=1fb8168cf2b5
> It is really incredible the amount of pushback I see from companies, startups to big, about writing. In particular around the notion that writing is the antithesis of agile. Writing ossifies and cements decision or plans that should change, it is said. My view is that agility comes from planning. Without plans, activities are just brownian motion. And you can’t have plans, especially shared plans, without writing.

I'm a huge fan of writing things down and I don't feel it happens enough. I enjoy writing, but I also find it is an excellent way to understand what you're thinking more clearly and to have clear discussions around that. It's also a skill that takes time to work on and needs practice.

### The 'Coffee Shop Effect': Why Changing Your Location Boosts Your Productivity
https://blog.trello.com/coffee-shop-effect-boosts-productivity
> By now, I’m embarrassingly familiar with the post-lunch slump that strikes at least once during my workweek... So, what do I do in those moments when I find myself feeling totally zapped of motivation? I pack up my laptop and head to a coffee shop with reliable WiFi.

This article convinced me that a change of scenery is an effective way to refocus yourself, particularly if you've got a location that you associate with productive habits.

### 101 Questions to Ask in One on Ones
https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/
> This list will help you make the most of each meeting and have a quick reference when you feel your questions may be getting stale or you have a few minutes left in a one on one.

It's a big list, but I've found a few of these questions have been really useful at opening up conversation in my catch ups.

### Manager Energy Drain
http://larahogan.me/blog/manager-energy-drain/
>  Color code your calendar based on the kind of brain you use in each event.

I started colour coding my calendar and suddenly realised that I was context switching all the time. It has helped to group activities more closely but also identify where I need to take breaks to help my brain have a better chance at switching contexts more effectively.

### 12 Statistics About Women in Tech That Show How Big the Gender Gap Truly Is
http://observer.com/2017/06/women-in-tech-statistics/
> Whether you’re looking at startup founders, investors or people in computing and technical roles, women often find themselves in rooms full of men... To spread awareness, we’ve compiled some stats that show just how bad the gender gap in tech really is.

As a manager, you have the power to influence decisions that can increase diversity in our industry. The stats in this article show the gap between men and women in our industry very clearly.

### A Counterintuitive Way to Increase Diversity in Tech
https://medium.com/@rachelnabors/a-counterintuitive-way-to-increase-diversity-in-tech-31aea2ce6a50
> Ok, so what CAN you do to help improve diversity in tech? Glad you asked! It’s simple: get into management.

Excellent article that talks about how if you want the industry to be more diverse you should start by looking at what you can change within your circle of influence. Becoming a manager is a great way to increase that influence.

### It’s Not Really A Technology Problem
https://medium.com/startup-patterns/its-not-really-a-technology-problem-5b534a642bb0
> The quality of a system is a reflection of the quality of the relationships between the people that build that system... If the key to producing a good product is to have a good culture producing it, then the key to producing a good culture is to design or transform your organization with the right processes and incentives that will produce that culture. 

Anyone who has worked on a team with talented people who struggle to produce high quality technical outcomes will find that this article resonates with them.

### How To Win An Argument
https://www.fs.blog/2014/06/winning-an-argument/
> If you want to win an argument, simply ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. Odds are they have not done the work required to hold an opinion. If they can explain why they are correct and how things would work, you'll learn something. If they can't you'll soften their views, perhaps nudging them ever so softly toward your views.

The title of the article sounds like manipulation more than team work, but the idea of asking people to delve deeper into their ideas so to gain new knowledge or to understand how deeply they've considered their idea is a great approach to moving discussions forward.

### How to fail as a new engineering manager
https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-fail-as-a-new-engineering-manager-30b5fb617a
> How do you succeed [as a new manager]? How do you once again rise up through these new ranks and achieve the same level of results and credibility that everyone is expecting, especially yourself? There are decades of books and thousands of blogs dedicated to trying to answer these questions, so I‘m not here to pretend that I’ve got the secret to success. But I do know a few ways that I’m pretty sure can guarantee you’ll fail.

This flips the conversation around and talks about what not to do. The conversation around whether you should code is particularly interesting.

### Who I want to work for
https://medium.com/@keavy/who-i-want-to-work-for-b04ce972c202
> I work at GitHub, as a senior engineer. I’m not looking for a job. But I have been thinking about leadership and what I’ve appreciated most from various bosses over the years... I started noting who I want to work for, in terms of an ideal leader.

So great to see a clear description of what someone wants from their ideal leader. The writer sets the bar high, but they seem like points all well worth aiming for.

### Track and Facilitate Your Engineers’ Flow States In This Simple Way
http://firstround.com/review/track-and-facilitate-your-engineers-flow-states-in-this-simple-way/
> The immersive, pleasurable state of flow is hard enough to describe, let alone generate and track... During 1:1s, Maxwell asks her reports to mark the [flow] graph to indicate where they are professionally. Using them in conversations would drain some of the objective, quantitative value from the exercise.

I've tried this exercise a few times to understand better if people in my team are challenged enough or too much. It has lead to some interesting conversations around the type of work people have been doing, well worth a try in my opinion.

### Quantifying Personal Retention Impact: A Mathematical Thought Exercise
http://royrapoport.blogspot.co.nz/2015/01/quantifying-personal-retention-impact.html?m=1
> So for a given person with whom you work, imagine they've left the company, and you're considering leaving the company to go to another company... What's your response, on a -3 to +3 scale?

An interesting thought experiement to assess how much you value someone that you work with.

### The 5 ways to improve your self-awareness as a leader
https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/the-5-ways-to-improve-your-self-awareness-as-a-leader-2f1464e5b00
> Without self-awareness, you can’t make informed decisions. You don’t know if you’re getting in your own way — if a strong irrational personal bias or misguided mental model is shaping your view on things.

As a manager you'll probably find yourself asking "Is it just me?". It could well be! Here are some approaches to trying to identify your own mental state and biases.

### Share your Manager README
https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/
> As a manager, on-boarding is both tough and really important whether you’re joining a team or they’re joining yours... With that in mind, I wrote a document that I share with new reports. I’ve shared this with people I’ve hired and with people whose team I’ve joined. In either case, I think it paints a picture of who I am and how I want to interact with them. I iterate on this with every new person I send it to, and I encourage discussion and feedback.

This article made me write my own [Manager Readme](README.md) which helped me and my team understand my role as a manager better.

### Taking Back "Software Engineering"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwSNjVTF168&feature=youtu.be
> Would you fly in a plane designed by a craftsman or would you prefer your aircraft to be designed by engineers? Engineering is the application of iterative, empirical, practical science to real-world problems ... The term "Software Engineering" has gained a bad reputation ... In recent years we have discovered what really works in software development. Continuous Delivery is about the application of an iterative, practical, empirical, maybe even science-based approach to solving problems in software development. Is this a form of software engineering? Engineering is different in different disciplines. Maybe it is time for us to begin thinking about retrieving the term "Software Engineering". Maybe it is time to define what our "Engineering" discipline should entail.

What is software engineering? This talk makes the case for software engineering being about a scientific approach to problem solving based on experimentation and learning. There's a great story about how NASA figured out how to get a rocket to the moon that sums up the iterative scientific approach well.

### Dynamic Reteaming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0weumS06PGY
> Who says you need "stable" teams in order to build a successful software company? While the addition or removal of one person from a team means you have a "new team", there is a myth out there about "stable" teams. When your team compositions change it doesn't mean you're doing it wrong - it could be the secret to your success.

This talk opened my eyes to the opportunities that "reteaming" can provide. It has some great examples of companies that embrace changing teams and how it has improved how they work.

### The NoEnd Developer
https://medium.com/@JoshuaKerievsky/the-noend-developer-f41f35603e64
> Over the years, I’ve met lots of amazing programmers, none of whom would describe themselves as frontend or backend developers. They don’t limit themselves to any end of the stack ... They have a growth mindset about programming. (A growth mindstack?!) ... There is no end to what a NoEnd developer can do. 

Developers who can turn their hand to the technologies and tools needed to deliver the software that's needed are highly valuable. This excellent article passionately explains why being a developer who is happy to continually be a novice on different technologies is the mindset that we want to encourage in our developers.

### It's 2017 and Mental Health is Still an Issue in the Workplace.
https://medium.com/@OlarkLiveChat/its-2017-and-mental-health-is-still-an-issue-in-the-workplace-61efbef092f
> It's 2017. We are in a knowledge economy. Our jobs require us to execute at peak mental performance. When an athlete is injured they sit on the bench and recover. Let’s get rid of the idea that somehow the brain is different.

The author shares a story about how an email he sent that thanked an employee for visibly taking a mental health day when needed was retweeted over 16,000 times. It highlights how uncommon it still is to take mental health days and how far the industry needs to go.

### Psychological Safety in Operation Teams
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_winter17_09_looney.pdf
> Let me highlight the impact an unsafe team can have on an individual, through the eyes of an
imaginary, capable, and enthusiastic new college graduate. 

Some excellent elaborations on Google's psychological safety studies with a few examples on how to increase psychological safety in your team.

### Kill The Elephants In The Room Before They Kill You
https://medium.com/positiveslope/kill-the-elephants-in-the-room-before-they-kill-you-9ccfbcc429fb
> A common mistake I observe in leaders of teams big and small is to aspire for peace as a default. You should be challenging peace as a default. Create an environment where people can withstand a fight and engage in friction as it arises.

Great advice here, with the caveat that the team needs to have the right level of psychological safety for everyone to contribute freely without negative effects from disagreements coming up.

### Radical Candor — The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss
http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/
> Radical candor, then, results from a combination of caring personally and challenging directly. But what does it look like in practice? 

We all know that honesty is the best policy, but this article talks about how having a strong personal relationship enables that honesty to be received positively.

### From a Group of Individuals to a Performing Team: Navigating the Tuckman’s Model
https://leadersyndrome.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/from-a-group-of-individuals-to-a-performing-team-navigating-the-tuckmans-model/
> Tuckman’s generic model of group development (proposed in 1965) suggests that, for a team to grow from a group of individuals to a performing team, 4 stages are necessary and inevitable: forming, storming, norming and performing ... Being able to identify the current maturity stage of your teams will help you to deploy the relevant approach and strategies to develop them to the next stage till they reach a maximal performance level.

You're probably familiar with the four stages of team development, but this article delves further with recommendations on moving on through each stage to performing team.

### The Six Styles of Leadership
https://intenseminimalism.com/2015/the-six-styles-of-leadership/
> According to Daniel Goleman there are six styles of leadership ... each style fits a different situation [and] a good leader needs to be able to switch them when the context requires that. A leadership style is thus a tool, not personality trait.

Different situations require different styles of management. As a manager/leader, being able to switch between styles naturally is an important skill to maximise your potential in each situation.

### How to Control Your Emotions During a Difficult Conversation
https://hbr.org/2017/12/how-to-control-your-emotions-during-a-difficult-conversation
> If your body goes into “fight or flight” mode or what Dan Goleman called “amygdala hijack,” you may lose access to the prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for rational thinking. And making rational decisions is precisely what you need to do in a difficult conversation. 

We've all been there. You're in a conversation and things get heated and you can no longer express your point or think clearly. This article has a few tips around breaking out of that state and trying to get back to rational thought.

### This Is What Impactful Engineering Leadership Looks Like
http://firstround.com/review/this-is-what-impactful-engineering-leadership-looks-like/
> To develop a long-term relationship with an engineer, you have to learn enough about them to provide a framework to think through their career growth together,” she says. “You want them to articulate 1) the skills they want to improve, 2) the technical and non-technical experiences they want to have, and 3) how they want to increase the scope of their impact at the company.

Some excellent observations and advice around the importance of day to day goals and long term (yearly) goals for developers.

### How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management
https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management
> Do managers matter? To find the answer, Google launched Project Oxygen, a multiyear research initiative. It has since grown into a comprehensive program that measures key management behaviors and cultivates them through communication and training. By November 2012, employees had widely adopted the program—and the company had shown statistically significant improvements in multiple areas of managerial effectiveness and performance.

Excellent research from Google on what makes a great manager. They've identified and measured the impact of 8 key factors that make a great manager.

### Veteran CTO (with Multiple Successful Exits) Answers Your Top Startup-Building Questions
http://firstround.com/review/veteran-cto-with-20-years-experience-answers-your-top-startup-building-questions/
> [Ajmal] has grown teams from tiny to gigantic across 7 companies. He did it at TenMarks ... until it was acquired by Amazon; at Posterous before it was snapped up by Twitter; and at Homestead before it joined Intuit — and more still. [Here's] Ajmal's AMA (questions submitted by a number of engineering leaders in our portfolio) and all of the advice he offered in response to the 12 toughest questions that we haven’t just heard here, but from many founders and technical leaders for years.

So much great information in here that it made my brain hurt trying to read it in one go.

### Speed as a Habit
http://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/
> The process of making and remaking decisions wastes an insane amount of time at companies. The key takeaway: WHEN a decision is made is much more important than WHAT decision is made. If, by way of habit, you consistently begin every decision-making process by considering how much time and effort that decision is worth, who needs to have input, and when you’ll have an answer, you'll have developed the first important muscle for speed.

We've probably all worked somewhere where decisions take a long time to get made, which has a negative impact on the organisation as a whole. I like the idea this article promotes of getting into the habit of being able to make decisions fast.

### The Curious Transition to Becoming an Engineering Manager
https://blog.gitprime.com/transition-to-engineering-manager/
> As an engineer, you are used to your work being more or less directly proportional to its impact. You write code, it advances a product’s development. You don’t write code, and it doesn’t. In management, however, the relationship between your work and its results is much more nuanced.

For those struggling with the change to management, this article has a number of astute observations.

---
### The New Science of Building Great Teams
https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams
> When we set out to document the behavior of teams that “click,” we noticed we could sense a buzz in a team even if we didn’t understand what the members were talking about. That suggested that the key to high performance lay not in the content of a team’s discussions but in the manner in which it was communicating. 

Excellent research by MIT about how the quality of social interactions in a team is a clear indicator of their performance.

---
### The Subtle Art of Delegation
https://medium.com/swlh/the-art-of-delegating-great-people-55cf1b4b752f
> I reflected on this with a more experienced mentor. The manager had done what I told them to do. Yet, here I was — frustrated, knowing that somehow the way I delegated wasn't working out for me. Then my mentor gave me some wise advice: "Delegate problems, not tasks"

Letting go and delegating out work is hard, but essential. Not only does this article give you great advice about delegation, but it also reinforces the reasons you should be delegating.

### The One Thing Every Software Engineer Should Know
https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-one-thing-every-software-engineer-should-know/
> OK, you're a genius programmer who can code circles around everyone else. But you may never ship any of your code for reasons that you don't control. That's an illusion. You can control when, how, and where your code ships. You probably spent too much time building your code and not enough time as an advocate of your code. Did you explain to people what your code does, why it's cool and important? Did you offer reasons why your code is going to make their lives better, at least in some small way? Did you make it easy for people to find and use your code?

This article really opened my eyes to value of being able to communicate the value of your code and coding ideas.

---

### Conflict Resolution
https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_81.htm
> When conflict arises, it's easy for people to get entrenched in their positions and for tempers to flare, voices to rise, and body language to become defensive or aggressive. You can avoid all of this by using the Interest-Based Relational (IBR) approach ... The approach is based on the idea that your role as a manager is not simply to resolve conflict but to ensure that team members feel respected and understood, and that you appreciate their differences. In essence, it helps you to manage conflict in a civil and "grown up" way.

When debates and disussions get out of hand, they have a negative impact on the team. As a manager you're in a position to help people find a way through conflict. I've used this approach and it helps cut to the core of the issue while ensuring people feel respected.

### The Best Career Advice I've Received
https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/10/15/the-best-career-advice-ive-received/
> Don't be a short-order cook, Self-promote, It's about people, None of this matters, Moving from "how?" to "what?", Act like you’re in charge, Let them win.

The author lays out a load of invaluable advice that he's received over his career. The advice is concise and I've passed on a few of these already.

### The Power of Anti Goals
https://medium.com/@awilkinson/the-power-of-anti-goals-c38f5f46d23c
> ... we decided to figure out how we could make our days consistently more enjoyable. To get there, we used a little trick that we learned from Warren Buffet's business partner, Charlie Munger, who is fond of saying "tell me where I’m going to die, so I'll never go there." ... He’s talking about inversion, the idea that problems are often best solved when they are reversed. That it’s often easier to think about what you don’t want than what you do 

I've found the "anti-goal" a useful approach when thinking about where I actually want to head. It sounds a bit negative, but ultimately the outcome is a positive one.

---

### Engineering Personas
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engineering-personas-casey-rosenthal
> Mental models can help us make decisions in complex situations. Choosing whom to hire is among the most complex situations that a manager faces. I created the Engineering Personas (EP) model as a framework to think about the type of talent that I want on a software engineering team ... If I find myself in a position where I want to change the behavior of someone reporting to me, I probably have the wrong person in that role. As a manager, I don’t want to change behavior, and I accept that it is impossible to change someone’s personality. I can’t even change what kinds of things motivate a person. At most, I can encourage or discourage someone’s existing motivation ... It’s very important then to hire people who already have the behavioral habits and motivation that a team needs. 

This engineering persona model is a way to simplify your understanding of the make up of a team and have easier discussions around how to grow or change that team.

---

### The Dangers of Measuring Performance
https://medium.com/startup-patterns/the-dangers-of-measuring-performance-d21cd61426df
> One of the earliest critics of measuring individual performance was W. Edwards Deming ... He was emphatic that the quality of output of any production system was due, overwhelmingly, to the configuration and organization of that system, rather than any individual worker’s performance. Thus it was inappropriate, thought Deming, to reward or punish individual workers for performance.

Excellent description of the value of team work over individual performance with a bit of management history thrown in to give it context.

### Team-Based Rewards Structures and Their Impact on Team Trust
https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/knowledge-lens/stories/2011/team-based-rewards.html
> Trust is a critical ingredient to ensuring a healthy team dynamic ... Team trust can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the structures organizations put in place to reward their employees. An analysis of team-based rewards [shows that] while they can be highly effective when implemented correctly, team-based rewards can also be a trigger for team trust challenges.

High functioning teams thrive on being assessed for their team output, but where there are trust issues this article lays out some research that can show a negative effect happening.

### On Being a Bad Manager
https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-being-a-bad-manager-e56e1fb3d9dc
> We're bad at most things by default. The only way to overcome the deficit is with the right kind of practice.
We can practice badly and get over small humps, but if really want to break through from bad to good — or to great — we have to put in deliberate, focused practice ... With some things this is straightforward. Want to get better at a sport? There are clearly documented methods and approaches to practice ... [but] how do you even practice management?

This is a brain dump from Jason Fried on why bad managers are easy to come by. Understanding the pitfalls and the difficulties around improving is a great start to becoming a better manager.

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html
> As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion ... Second, the good teams ... were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 

If you ever needed any evidence that a successful team is more than just hiring the most clever people, here it is.

### Atlassian Boosted Its Female Technical Hires By 80% — Here's How
http://firstround.com/review/atlassian-boosted-its-female-technical-hires-by-80-percent-heres-how/
> Organizations that explicitly label themselves as meritocratic (or, you know, talk about how they are all the time) end up pretty dramatically favoring men when it comes to hiring, promotions and raises. Researchers believe this happens because managers at these companies perceive themselves as more impartial, and are therefore less self-aware and less likely to root out and bust their biases.

It sounds like Atlassian are making great strides to a more gender equal workforce. There's a lot to be learned from this article.

### Worry is the Most Useless Emotion
https://m.signalvnoise.com/worry-is-the-most-useless-emotion-a7cf0ec65474
> Most of my worry stems from feeling a lack of control over a situation. I want something to turn out a certain way. So I start to feel overwhelmed and worried when I don’t believe I have the agency to influence that outcome. Here’s the funny thing, though: We have more control than we think. We can control ourselves — our actions, reactions, decisions, and beliefs. What we can’t control are other people and external events. And if that’s the case, well, why bother worrying about them? Let’s choose to focus on the former: The things we can control.

Falling into patterns of worrying doesn't achieve anything. In fact, it usually has the opposite effect of causing stress and confusing thoughts and conversations. This post talks about how to identify the cause of the worry and turn it into something useful.

### Basecamp Employee Handbook
https://github.com/basecamp/handbook
> For over 10 years, we didn’t have a handbook. In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to a company of over 50, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it... This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated.

This is probably the cleanest and most concise handbook I've seen. Making it public like this is a bold move too and I imagine only increases the transparency in the company about how it operates.

### Head to Lead People and Be a Manager
https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/mobilebasic
>Since 2013-ish, I’ve been keeping a collection of links and notes on the broad topics of “leadership” and “management” on this very Google doc. I shared it with friends who are transitioning to management roles but kept it private to the world at large. Then I figured I should “open source” it. 

This rough and ready Google Doc looks terrible but contains excellent summaries of articles related to leadership and management. I often read the notes on 1:1s each week to remind me how to run mine more effectively.

### How to Communicate Effectively as an Engineer Without Resorting to Management Speak
https://www.tombartel.de/blog/communicate-effectively-without-management-speak/
>Engineers like to be concise, but a concise communication style is not always the most effective one. Being a bit more verbose can increase clarity, emphasize important points, and create an atmosphere that allows for more creative exploration.

This opened my eyes to something I've been guilty of my entire career: describing things too concisely and expecting people to understand. There are some excellent compare and contrast examples of how a little padding, energy and inspiration can communicate your message more clearly.

### The Engineer/Manager Pendulum
https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/
> Promoting managers from within means you get those razor sharp skills from the people who just built the thing. That gives them credibility, while they struggle with their newly achieved incompetence in a different role. That’s one of the only ways you can achieve the temporary glory of a hybrid manager+tech lead. This is an unstable combination, because your engineering skills and context-sharpness are decaying the longer you do it.

As someone who has bounced between programmer/management roles in my career, this article resonates with my experiences. The further away from coding you are, the less technically minded/able you are - however the better a manager you'll be. Then the pendulum swings back the other way as you get back into programming and your management skills get rusty. This post argues that this isn't a bad thing.

### Elon Musk: The Secret Behind His Insane Drive
https://medium.com/personal-growth/elon-musk-how-to-sustain-motivation-b0ddfebe3a5e
>The surest way to kill motivation is by attempting to tackle something beyond our capabilities. Easy enough to avoid, right? Not always. In fact, most long-term goals require skills that we don’t have when we set the goals ... The initial mission of Tesla, Musk’s sustainable energy company, was "to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible." ... It’s a lofty goal, and it’s one that was beyond the scope of the skills and resources he had when he began. Everybody thought he was insane. That didn’t stop him, though. He broke it down into three smaller parts.

This post talks about how Elon Musk's grand visions are broken down into smaller parts and then a focus on trials and assessing failure pushes the project towards the bigger goal.

### Making Your Workplace Safe for Grief
https://hbr.org/2017/06/making-your-workplace-safe-for-grief
> many companies lack norms or policies for dealing with grief — or “bereavement,” in HR-speak. Those that do have policies often find they’re insufficient. There are strict rules around what type of grief makes one eligible for leave. In most countries, a stillbirth doesn’t warrant bereavement leave, nor does the loss of a best friend, a favorite aunt, or a beloved nephew. In the U.S., Oregon is the only state to guarantee paid bereavement leave. Most current bereavement policies suggest that an employee should absorb their shock, plan and execute a funeral, cope in a healthy way with their loss, and then return to work within three days at full engagement.

Life has its ups and downs. How we help people through difficulties times is a real test of leadership and this post is full of helpful ideas and advice on how to do that.

### Listening is The Job
http://boz.com/articles/listening-is-the-job.html
> People are much better at adding channels to consume than they are about removing them, but both are equally important. There is too much information and not enough time to consume it all. Take time to assess your incoming channels, and ask yourself how likely each is to provide you with critical information. Prune channels aggressively when you find you are spending time but rarely getting value.

We can get bombarded with information at work and this post is an excellent reminder that we need to spend time working out how to best manage that information.

### Reducing Hours by Focusing Your Job
https://wildbit.com/blog/2017/06/05/reducing-hours-by-focusing-your-job
>To achieve the same amount of work in less time, we have to make sure that we’re all working on the right things and that everyone is clear on their part in our combined success ... One of the biggest challenges is that job descriptions are really vague, and don’t help someone clearly identify what work they need to do—like actual tasks they are expected to accomplish. And even if you’ve defined it clearly, roles change as the needs of a business change.

It seems obvious after reading this post, but defining what do actually do at work is the first step in identifying where we should focus our attention. This post suggests a great use of mind maps to identify your repsonsibilites and then create a plan on where to focus.

### A Growth Plan for Designers
https://medium.com/we-build-vend/a-growth-plan-for-designers-21c8f287e63a
> Knowing where you are, what you have to focus on next, and what you need to achieve to reach the "next step" are difficult questions to answer, but also some of the most important questions a manager must help answer ...  The visual expression of ... competencies help with this. They literally create a shape for each [person], and a shape for each role. They help [people] determine which skillsets they need to develop, to "fill out" the roles they want to be in. And ... they provide a roadmap for how that designer goes about getting there.

I've seen a few competency frameworks in my career, but this one from Vend has a striking visual approach that helps to show areas of potential growth. The post also reiterates the importance of having a system so you can understand what your "next step" should be.

> Mentioning Agile rarely moves the conversation forward, especially with folks outside of the Agile-nerd bubble ... Any Google search yields the fact that many of the debates on Agile and Scrum are almost a decade old. They’re not getting resolved…the confusion lingers. I’d argue they are getting worse as “Agile” gets older, gets marketed/sold, and becomes the default ... Agile encompasses a number of valuable patterns, practices, and perspectives. It also comes with a good deal of baggage. Modern Agile as it is purposefully free of specific practices, and has applicability for the whole organization.

### Modern Agile
http://modernagile.org/
> Over the past decade, innovative companies, software industry thought leaders and lean/agile pioneers have discovered simpler, sturdier, more streamlined ways to be agile. These modern approaches share a focus on producing exceptional outcomes and growing an outstanding culture. Today, it makes far more sense to bypass antiquated agility in favor of modern approaches. Modern agile methods are defined by four guiding principles ... World famous organizations like Google, Amazon, AirBnB, Etsy and others are living proof of the power of these four principles.

We've learned a lot since the Agile Manifesto was published over 15 years ago. "Modern Agile" condenses those learnings into four principles that feel more applicable to modern software development than the Agile Manifesto does.
